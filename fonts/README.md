# Fonts
Various custom fonts (character sets) are used within the game; some for actual text - others as character graphics.  These are cataloged here in two sections; one the fonts/character sets I've created myself, the other those created by (and used with permission from/licenses to) others:

**"high_noon.fnt"** - This custom wood-stamp/burn style font, called "[High Noon](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/high-noon/)" was created by "[Damien G.](https://damieng.com)".

Damien has made hundreds of excellent fonts available, in multiple formats (including Atari .FNT files), on his [typography page](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/), [here](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/), and is gracious and generous enough to allow them to be used with just a mention in the game's credits.
