# Fonts
Various custom fonts (character sets) are used within the game; some for actual text - others as character graphics.  These are cataloged here in two sections; one the fonts/character sets I've created myself, the other those created by (and used with permission from/licenses to) others:

### My Fonts
These fonts are my own creations.  I use several tools for creating them ([Pixaki](https://pixaki.com), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=RBS7NL7F&mv=other) and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) primarily).  In general, I will keep the original source file, a .GIF version and the final .FNT files here, so they can easily be edited and/or used:



#### Font Tools

I have created tools for converting image (.GIF and .PNG) to .FNT files ([image2fnt](https://github.com/idunmore/AtariTools/tree/main/image2fnt)), and for converting .FNT files to  "data" statements for various assemblers (for assemblers that don't support direct inclusion of binary files) and Atari BASIC ([fnt2data](https://github.com/idunmore/AtariTools/tree/main/fnt2data)).

### Fonts by Others

**"high_noon.fnt"** - This custom wood-stamp/burn style font, called "[High Noon](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/high-noon/)" was created by "[Damien G.](https://damieng.com)".

Damien has made hundreds of excellent fonts available, in multiple formats (including Atari .FNT files), on his [typography page](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/), [here](https://damieng.com/typography/zx-origins/), and is gracious and generous enough to allow them to be used with just a mention in the game's credits.
