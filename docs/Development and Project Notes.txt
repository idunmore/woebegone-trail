General Notes:

  Placeholder files to get project folders created, committed, and the project
  definitions/settings in place to verify structure, environmnet, tools and
  that the code assembles.

Includes & Dependencies:

  This game uses my "atari-8-bit-includes-mads" project as a GIT SUBPROJECT to
  provide various hardware register, bit settings, values and macros.

  Commits and pulls to/from this subproject must be handled separately; they
  will not automatically update with upstream changes.

TODOs:

  title.asm 

    This is currently very quick/dirty - just testing and proving techniques
    and working through various timing and sequencing issues.

      * Add data to show hills/mountains for full display.

      * Add foreground/rock scrolling.
      
      * Refactor/rename all labels for conditional operation.

      * Properly comment DLIs and DLIST mode line behavior.

      * PMG for SUN needs to be moved (PMG 2?) so it can have higher priority
        than the lines of scrolling clouds (clouds must ALWAYS obscure the sun).
