General Notes:

  Placeholder files to get project folders created, committed, and the project
  definitions/settings in place to verify structure, environmnet, tools and
  that the code assembles.

Includes & Dependencies:

  This game uses my "atari-8-bit-includes-mads" project as a GIT SUBPROJECT to
  provide various hardware register, bit settings, values and macros.

  Commits and pulls to/from this subproject must be handled separately; they
  will not automatically update with upstream changes.

TODOs:

  title.asm 

    This is currently very quick/dirty - just testing and proving techniques
    and working through various timing and sequencing issues.

      * Consistency pass, for label/EQUATE casing, comment alignment/positioning

      * Test ? prefix on Labels for common branch target names (next, nope,
        skip etc.)

      * PROPER graphics for rocks/greenery.

      * Look at moving ALL scrolling movement, include the text scroller and PMG
        cloud, to run off the "scaler" code running the clouds/hills/rocks
        bands.

      * Switch CONSTANTS for colors, to use the name colors in colors.asm -
        in the form [DARK_ORANGE | $08] (LUMA)

      * Refactor/rename all labels for conditional operation.

      * Properly comment DLIs and DLIST mode line behavior.

      * PMG for SUN needs to be moved (PMG 2?) so it can have higher priority
        than the lines of scrolling clouds (clouds must ALWAYS obscure the sun).
