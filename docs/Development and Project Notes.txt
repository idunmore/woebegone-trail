General Notes:

  Placeholder files to get project folders created, committed, and the project
  definitions/settings in place to verify structure, environmnet, tools and
  that the code assembles.

Includes & Dependencies:

  This game uses my "atari-8-bit-includes-mads" project as a GIT SUBPROJECT to
  provide various hardware register, bit settings, values and macros.

  Commits and pulls to/from this subproject must be handled separately; they
  will not automatically update with upstream changes.

TODOs:

  title.asm 

    This is currently very quick/dirty - just testing and proving techniques
    and working through various timing and sequencing issues.

    !!! Update HILL/MOUNTAIN scrolling, and other VBI/DLIs, to allow each
        region to scroll at different speeds.  Will likely need new DLIs on a
        per "block" basis, directly handling color (vs. a table-driven
        approach), and HSCROL.

      * Will require a series of slowly-incrementing counters, with resets
        PMG and HSCROLL positioning, at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 frames per increment.

        These will drive the clouds and other "parallax" elements of the
        scrolling display.

      * Lots of tidy-up with scrollers and resetting LMS values when scroll
        limits are reached.

      * Refactor/rename all labels for conditional operatio.

      * Properly comment DLIs and DLIST mode line behavior.

      * PMG for SUN needs to be moved (PMG 2?) so it can have higher priority
        than the lines of scrolling clouds (clouds must ALWAYS obscure the sun).
