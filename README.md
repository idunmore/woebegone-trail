# The Woebegone Trail
## An homage to “[The Oregon Trail](https://oregontrail.ws)” for Atari 8-bit Home Computers

“The Woebegone Trail” is an homage to the 1985 release of “The Oregon Trail” for the Apple II (not the original 1971 text-based mainframe game).  The Apple II version is what most people recall - and is the one for which almost all the screenshots, and the “Died of Dysentery” memes, are based upon.

[R. Philip Bouchard](http://www.philipbouchard.com/), who was the Lead Designer for the 1985 Apple II version and has published an excellent book (in the spirit of many of the game-inspired memes), “[You Have Died of Dysentery – The Creation of The Oregon Trail](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B8JMKMC/)” which goes deep into the details of the game design, as well as the delivery the overall project.

I maintain a dev-log for this project, “[Press START to Die of Dysentery](https://forums.atariage.com/blogs/blog/862-press-start-to-die-of-dysentery/)” at [Atari Age](https://atariage.com), if you’re interested in more background, and the progress, rationale, and decisions in/around this project.

### Why do this for the Atari 8-bit line?
The Atari 8-bit line are the computers for which I have the fondest memories, was where I learned to do real assembly language work, and is a platform that does not have an Apple II style/level version of the game (the Atari 800 version was closer to the 1971 text-based game).

### Why “Woebegone”?
 
Let’s start with a definition:
 
**Woebegone** [phn: woh-bi-gawn, -gon]
 
adjective:
 
1. Beset with woe; surrounded by woe; affected by woe, especially in appearance.
2. Showing or indicating woe.
	 
Beyond the events of the game, reading some history of the Oregon Trail paints a hopeful, but hard and often miserable, transit.  The grit, motivation, and courage of those that undertook this journey astounds me.  But I’m still pretty sure they experienced their fair share of woe along the way.

So “Woebegone” seems a fitting adjective.  

In addition, and somewhat conveniently,  the word “woebegone” sounds a _bit_ like “Oregon”.
